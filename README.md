# Todo Application
New simply todo application

# What the application can do

1. List all todos : simple list of all todos created for each one a checkbox and link to see more
2. Change a TODO state : by ckecking the checkbox and clicking the update button, a todo can change its state.
3. Detail a TODO : by clicking on a todo's title, you can see more detail about the todo in a dedicated view.
4. Add a new TODO : by clicking the add button at the bottom of the list, you can fill a form in a dedicated view to add a todo. Only 2 fields : title (which is required) and description.

# Technical environment
- Made with PHP, Bootstrap for UI, 
- Code covered by unit tests
- Github pages : if I understood correctly, Github Pages doesn't support PHP, it's only for static code. So I didn't manage to set it up.
- Mocked backend with Mock API (https://mockapi.io/)
